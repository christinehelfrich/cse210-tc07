NAME: JOHN STAVAST

I am a student in Applied Technology and am loving what I am currently studying. I am changing professions. I have a doctorate in physical therapy and also did a residency specializing in manual therapy which
in layman terms would be similar to chiropractics. I decided that I didn't love my profession as much as writing software and needed to make a change. I have a loving wife, 1 puppy and a baby boy on the way. 
I am currently selling my house and moving states.

Christine - I was born in Seattle WA on December 25 1999. 6 years later, my father decided to relocate us from the city into the beautiful rocky mountains. Once I graduated from high school in 2018, I immediately moved to Southern Utah to attend college. Though I loved every second of it, I soon decided to move to Paris to finish my studies for my associate's degree. Once again, I loved Paris, but once my studies were done I relocated yet again to Hawaii to live out my dream of being a photographer.

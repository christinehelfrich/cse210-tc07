I am a student in Applied Technology and am loving what I am currently studying. I am changing professions. I have a doctorate in physical therapy and also did a residency specializing in manual therapy which
in layman terms would be similar to chiropractics. I decided that I didn't love my profession as much as writing software and needed to make a change. I have a loving wife, 1 puppy and a baby boy on the way. 
I am currently selling my house and moving states.

McKay is a code monkey. He is very diligent but his output stinks
(according to Rob). McKay likes Frittos as well as Tab and 
Mountain Dew. He is a simple man with a warm fuzzy secret heart.


Christine - I was born in Seattle WA on December 25 1999. 6 years later, my father decided to relocate us from the city into the beautiful rocky mountains. Once I graduated from high school in 2018, 
I immediately moved to Southern Utah to attend college. Though I loved every second of it, I soon decided to move to Paris to finish my studies for my associate's degree. Once again, I loved Paris, but once my studies were done I relocated yet again to Hawaii to live out my dream of being a photographer.
